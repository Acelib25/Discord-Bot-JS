# Discord-Bot-JS

This was a big learning opportunity for me and it was a blast to make. 
However, progress requires effort. While you CAN NOT take my bots code to use in your bot, you CAN use my code as a reference to inspire your code. 
I would be happy to explain my code choices and what they do.

If you have any questions join my discord server or DM me :D
