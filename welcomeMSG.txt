Hello my name is Ace. I wrote @ACE-JavaScript#5590  to help with this RP. As its creator I would like to offer some advice about how it works.
1. The help command is **`-help`**. You can use **`-help <command>`** for information on a specific command.
2. Your Money = **`-bal`**. Everyone's money = **`-baltop`**. Shop is **`-shop`**.To buy an item is  **`-buy <item>`**. **`-inv`** to see your items.
3. To look around a room enter its related channel and say` -room`.
4. **`-slots <amount of money>`** to gamble in #casino-floor . Be careful or you might lose it all. >:D
5. There are many fun commands. **`-kill`** is one of them. It is **NOT** used to kill people in game.
6. If you need help please feel free to DM me.
Enjoy the RP!!!
